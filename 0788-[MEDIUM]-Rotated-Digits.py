    Intuition:
        Use digit DP approach. Top-down since we recurse from pos=0 and memoize
        on the way back up.

        Our memo table has 3 dimensions for the 3 "pieces" of state we need to
        carry forward to solve the next step: the current digit's position, if
        the bound is tight or not (constrains the next digit we can select...
        if tight, then bound to input prefix, else can choose whatever digit),
        and if the rotated version incurs a change (e.g. 1 rotated does not
        change, we track if the prefix has incurred a change so far).

        We initialize the memo table with sentinel values to disinguish between
        computed and uncomputed steps.

        The base case in our recursive DP helper function checks if we have
        selected all digits and if the rotated digit incurs a change. We also
        peek the memo table and return the value of our current state if it is
        stored.

        Then, we compute what our next digit's limit is and iterate through
        the candidates. We prune invalid candidates (do not yield valid rotations),
        recursively compute subproblems, and populate the memo table.

    Runtime:
        Let D be the number of digits we have to pick (bound by 5 via constraints
        with n = 10^4). 'tight' can take 2 possible values (0/1 for F/T respectively)
        and 'has_change' as well. This gives us 2 * 2 * D = 4 * D possible states.

        At each step, we can choose 10 possible digits which represents the amount of
        work we have to do.

        Thus, the runtime complexity is O(10 * (4 * D)) ~ O(40 * D) ~ O(D) ~ O(1) since
        D <= 5.

    Memory:
        O(4 * D) ~ O(D) since we need to memoize potentially all states. Here, D is the
        number of digits in the input 'n'.
