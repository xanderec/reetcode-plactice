class Solution:
    """
    Intuition:
        Add another loop on top of 3Sum solution to pick 4th
        elmt.

    Runtime:
        O(n log n) to sort.

        O(n^3) to find quadruplets with 3 loops; 2 for-loops,
        1 while-loop.

        Overall, O(n^3) dominates.

    Memory:
        Number of distinct quadruplets we can form is n^3, so
        at worst O(n^3) memory for 'res' array. This is because
        we have n choices for a, n choices for b, n choices for
        c. But once we have chosen the first 3 elmts, the fourth
        one becomes deterministic. This means we have n * n * n
        which gives n^3.

        Note that auxiliary memory usage is O(1).
