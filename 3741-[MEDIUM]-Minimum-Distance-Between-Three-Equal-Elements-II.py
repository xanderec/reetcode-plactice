    Intuition:
        We can keep track of 2 hashmaps. 1 for the last index of an
        encountered number and another for the index previous to the
        last one.

        While looping through the input, we update both hashmaps
        accordingly. Whenever we match on an element existing in
        `prevprev`, then we know we should compute if the distance is
        a new min.

    Runtime:
        O(n) since every element in the input array is processed once.

    Memory:
        O(n) space for the `prev` hashmap.

        O(n) space for the `prevprev` hashmap. Feel like this is a very
        loose upper bound since it will never be as populated as `prev`
        due to it requiring its elements to have frequency 2. So I guess
        O(n / 2) ~ O(n).
