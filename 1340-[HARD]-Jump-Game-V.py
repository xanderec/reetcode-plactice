    """
    Intuition:
        We use a top-down DP approach and store the current position
        as the only piece of state.

        We start each recursive step by computing all the neighbours
        in the interval [pos - d, pos + d] that we can jump to. Our
        base case here is when we can't jump to any other neighbour,
        in which case we know the answer is 1. Otherwise, we iterate
        through all possible jumps and compute the maximum.

        We also start the DP search from every index to find the one
        yiedling the max amt of jumps.

    Runtime:
        We have n possible positions or states. At each state, we
        incur up to O(d) amount of work, which leads our runtime
        complexity to be bounded by O(n * d).

    Memory:
        O(n) for the memo cache.

        O(n) for the recursive stack depth.

        Overall, O(n) memory.

    Intuition:
        Bottom-up DP solution to avoid overhead incurred by recursion.

        We sort the elements of the input array by value because by
        processing the indices in ascending order of their respective
        values, we ensure that smaller neighbours have been computed
        for the current index/value pair we are on. Thus, we can simply
        perform a O(1) lookup to our DP cache to figure out the current
        solution.

    Runtime:
        Sorting takes O(n * log n).

        Iterating through the sorted pairs and scanning the neighbours
        we can jump to still takes O(n * d).

        Finding the maximum value in our DP cache takes O(n) time.

        Overall, we have a runtime complexity bounded by O(n * d) unless
        d <<< n in which case O(n * log n) dominates.
