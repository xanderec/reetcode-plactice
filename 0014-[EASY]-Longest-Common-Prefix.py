class Solution2:
    """
    Intuition:
        For prefix matching, we have tries. We can use it to insert every
        string given to us and find the longest prefix by checking at each
        iteration the number of keys stored in the current level of the trie.

        Note that this solution is a bit less optimal, but an interesting
        alternative.

    Runtime:
        O(N * k) to insert all the strings where N is the number of strings and
        k is the length of the longest string.

        O(s) to find the longest prefix where s is the length of the shortest
        string in the array.

        Overall runtime bounded by insertion i.e. O(N * k) which is slightly
        less optimal than Solution 1.

    Memory:
        The trie holds every character given to us in the input string array.
        Thus, the memory complexity is O(N * k) where N is the number of strings
        and k is the length of the longest string. This is also worse than the
        memory complexity of Solution 1.
