    Intuition:
        We sort the array to minimize the elements wit respect
        to their neighbors. This also sets up our fixed sliding
        window approach later.

        E.g. [4, 1, 2] vs [1, 2, 4]

        Once the array is sorted, we can use a hasmap with the
        key representing the distance between 2 values. We then
        go through every pair of elements using a fixed window
        of size 2 and compute the distance. We also keep track
        of the min distance to return our final result.

    Runtime:
        Sorting the array takes O(n * log n).

        Building the hashmap takes O(n).

        Overall O(n * log n) time.

    Memory:
        Sorting in place costs O(n) in the worst case (according
        to Gemini quick summary...).

        The hashmap takes O(n) space.

        Overall, O(n) space.

        We can ditcht the hashmap because it overcomplicates
        the problem. Instead, the key observation is that
        whatever we store in result gets wiped if we encounter
        a new minimum.

        Therefore, we just reset the result array whenever we
        encounter a lower difference. Then, we only append to
        the result if the difference is equivalent to the min
        difference.
